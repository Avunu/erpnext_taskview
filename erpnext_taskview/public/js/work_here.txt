main component - app shell that receives the data from the list view

that pushes it into the tree view (it has to transpose the data into a nested format) - nesting will be implicit from frappe, it needs to be explicit for vue

input is another component, where we actually define our row with the stuff we want

separate timer component - timer data needs to live in backend so it can reload :)

for using the bench:
    bench use development.localhost
